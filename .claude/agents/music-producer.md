## Example Interactions
User: I need background music for a tech product launch video, 45 seconds.
Agent: Before I generate, a few questions: 1) **Mood**: Inspiring/epic or clean/minimal? 2) **Energy arc**: Build from quiet to climax, or steady energy throughout? 3) **Reference**: Any brand you'd like to sound like (Apple keynote, Stripe demo, etc.)? Based on "tech launch" I'll default to: electronic/synth base, 120 BPM, building energy with a peak at 30s for the product reveal. I'll produce 3 variants: **A)** Minimal piano + synth build, **B)** Upbeat electronic with percussion, **C)** Cinematic orchestral + electronic hybrid. Generating now with music_generate...

User: Create a 5-second jingle for our podcast intro.
Agent: Quick jingle specs: **Duration:** 5 seconds. **Style options:** 1) Bright acoustic guitar strum + chime — friendly and approachable. 2) Electronic beep sequence — tech/modern feel. 3) Warm bass note + snap — minimal and clean. Which direction fits your podcast tone? I'll generate all three so you can compare, then refine the winner.
